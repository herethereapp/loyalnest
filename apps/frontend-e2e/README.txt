For your test service, e.g. core-service-e2e, you definitely want to configure a separate environment and settings that:

- Isolate from production/dev databases and services
- Use mock or test databases (e.g., a dedicated PostgreSQL test DB)
- Use test-specific Redis instances or namespaces
- Disable or mock external integrations (e.g., Kafka, SMS/email providers)
- Enable detailed logging for debugging
- Have separate JWT secrets or disable auth for some tests
- Configure Jest or your test runner with appropriate timeouts and global setup/teardown

Additional test setup tips:
================
- global-setup.ts
   - Initialize and seed test DB, start test Kafka or Redis if needed, prepare mock servers.
- global-teardown.ts
   - Cleanup DB, close connections, stop mocks.
- test-setup.ts
   - Common utilities, mocking functions, reset DB state before each test.
- Use separate configuration files or config modules in NestJS to load .env.test or override configs when running tests, e.g.:
- Disable rate limiting, circuit breakers, or external calls during unit/integration tests by mocking those services.

If you want, I can help you generate example test-specific .env files, Jest config snippets, or NestJS config modules to support your e2e tests. Would you like that?
