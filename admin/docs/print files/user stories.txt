To create complete user stories for the Herethere Loyalty App, I'll leverage the provided schema.sql, roadmap.txt, flowchart, wireframes, ERD, and sequence diagrams to define user stories that cover all functionalities across the Customer Widget, Merchant Dashboard, Admin Module, and backend integrations (e.g., Shopify, Twilio) for Phases 1–3. User stories will follow the standard format: As a [user], I want [functionality], so that [benefit]. They will address all features outlined in the roadmap, including points earning/redemption, referrals, VIP tiers, analytics, settings, and gamification, ensuring alignment with the schema's tables (e.g., customers, points_transactions, rewards) and the sequence diagrams' flows.

The user stories will be organized by component (Customer Widget, Merchant Dashboard, Admin Module) and phase (1, 2, 3), with acceptance criteria to ensure clarity and testability. They will be wrapped in a single <xaiArtifact> with a new UUID, using text/markdown as the content type for readability and structure, as this is a distinct artifact from previous ones.

How to Use
Review User Stories:
Open the Markdown file in a viewer (e.g., VS Code, GitHub) to read structured stories.
Use for sprint planning, development, or testing.
Integrate with Project:

Copy
Copy-Item HerethereLoyaltyAppUserStories.md docs/
git add docs/HerethereLoyaltyAppUserStories.md
git commit -m "Add user stories"
git push
Link to wireframes (artifact ID: 5602c38b-b8e9-4dfa-9363-3eb49a0d0460) and sequence diagrams (artifact ID: 06d9aa65-49a8-4519-aa2c-b4f68806553c) for design and flow context.
Test with GUI App:
The Python GUI apps (flowchart_gui_app_optimized.py, sequence_diagram_gui_app.py) don't directly render Markdown. To view user stories in a GUI, you'd need a new app with Markdown rendering (e.g., using tkinter and markdown). Let me know if you want this.
Troubleshooting:
If stories miss specific features, verify against schema.sql and roadmap.txt. All tables (e.g., customers, rewards) and roadmap features (e.g., VIP tiers, gamification) are covered.
For Windows, ensure PowerShell commands run with Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned.
Notes
Completeness: The 39 user stories cover all roadmap features and schema tables, ensuring comprehensive coverage of Phases 1–3.
Alignment: Stories align with the ERD (artifact ID: c53b350e-4720-4850-a19f-28eedf6fd132) and sequence diagrams, referencing the same tables and APIs.
Next Steps:
Prioritize stories for sprints (e.g., Phase 1 first).
Validate with stakeholders or test against API endpoints (e.g., POST /points/earn).
If you need stories in another format (e.g., Jira tickets, CSV), or additional stories for edge cases, let me know.
Confirm if the GUI apps are working (check sequence_app.log or flowchart_app.log) to guide further integrations
