To implement the RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) configuration feature for the LoyalNest App, targeting small, medium, and Shopify Plus merchants (100–50,000+ customers, AOV $20–$500), this task list outlines actionable steps using NestJS with TypeScript, Vite + React, Rust with Shopify Functions, PostgreSQL, and Redis. The plan prioritizes a minimum viable feature with iterative improvements, focusing on usability, performance, GDPR compliance, and multilingual support.

**Task List for Implementing RFM Configuration**

**Phase 1: Planning and Setup**

*Goal*: Establish a robust foundation for RFM configuration, aligning with merchant needs, Shopify Plus, and GDPR.

*Enhancements & Best Practices*:
- Interview 3–5 merchants, including one Plus merchant, to validate requirements.
- Incorporate GDPR compliance (encrypted customer data, webhook handling).
- Support multilingual UI and notifications for international merchants.
- Use PostHog to track merchant interactions.

1. **Define Feature Requirements**
   - *Description*: Finalize RFM configuration scope for small, medium, and Plus merchants.
   - *Tasks*:
     - Document RFM thresholds (Recency: days, Frequency: orders, Monetary: spend, e.g., 5 = <30 days, 5 = 5+ orders, 5 = $200+).
     - Specify 2–5 tiers (name, RFM criteria, rewards) with RBAC for Plus merchants.
     - Define adjustment frequencies (daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, event-based).
     - Include multilingual notification settings (Klaviyo templates, JSONB).
     - Add GDPR webhook handling (`customers/data_request`, `customers/redact`).
     - Define success metrics: 80%+ wizard completion, 10%+ repeat purchase rate increase.
   - *Deliverable*: Requirements document (Notion/Google Docs) with Plus and GDPR considerations.

2. **Analyze Merchant Data Patterns**
   - *Description*: Study purchase cycles and AOV to suggest default RFM thresholds.
   - *Tasks*:
     - Use Shopify Analytics to calculate median purchase interval and AOV for small (AOV $20), medium (AOV $100), and Plus (AOV $500) merchants.
     - Example: Small: Monetary 5 = $100+, Medium: $500+, Plus: $2,500+.
     - Validate with 3–5 merchant personas (e.g., pet store, fashion, electronics).
   - *Deliverable*: Default RFM thresholds for small, medium, and Plus merchants.

3. **Set Up Development Environment**
   - *Description*: Configure NestJS, Vite + React, and Shopify Functions for development.
   - *Tasks*:
     - Initialize branch (`feature/rfm-config`).

     - Install Shopify CLI for Rust Functions.
   - *Deliverable*: Dev environment with GraphQL, partitioned database, and PostHog.

**Phase 2: Backend Development (NestJS/TypeScript)**

*Goal*: Build scalable backend logic for RFM calculations, tier assignments, and notifications.

*Enhancements & Best Practices*:
- Use API versioning (`/api/v1/rfm/*`) for compatibility.
- Implement input validation and GDPR-compliant encryption.
- Optimize for Plus-scale (50,000+ customers) with partitioning and Redis caching.

4. **Integrate Shopify APIs**
   - *Description*: Fetch customer/order data for RFM calculations.
   - *Tasks*:

       ```graphql
       query {
         customer(id: "gid://shopify/Customer/123") { id, email, orders(first: 100) { edges { node { totalPrice, createdAt } } } }
       }
       ```
     - Create endpoints: `GET /api/v1/customers`, `GET /api/v1/orders` with pagination.
     - Cache results in PostgreSQL (`customers`, `orders`) and Redis (`rfm:customer:{id}`).
     - Verify webhook signatures for `orders/create`, `customers/data_request`, `customers/redact`.
     - Handle rate limits (2 req/s REST, 40 req/s Plus, 1–4 req/s Storefront) with exponential backoff.
   - *Deliverable*: GraphQL-based API service with webhook verification.

5. **Implement RFM Calculation Logic**
   - *Description*: Calculate RFM scores based on merchant thresholds.
   - *Tasks*:
     - Define TypeScript interfaces:

       interface RFMConfig { recency: string; frequency: number; monetary: number }
       interface RFMScore { recency: number; frequency: number; monetary: number }
       ```
     - Write NestJS service to compute RFM scores, store in `customers.rfm_score` (JSONB).
     - Add constraints: `CHECK (rfm_score->>'recency' IN ('1', '2', '3', '4', '5'))`.
     - Cache scores in Redis (`rfm:customer:{id}`, TTL 24h).
     - Support multilingual RFM nudges (`nudges.title` as JSONB).
   - *Deliverable*: RFM calculation service with constraints and caching.

6. **Develop Tier Assignment Logic**
   - *Description*: Assign customers to tiers based on RFM scores.
   - *Tasks*:
     - Create NestJS service to map RFM scores to tiers (`program_settings.config`).

     - Implement grace period in `program_settings.config` (JSONB, e.g., `{"grace_period_days": 30}`).
     - Handle GDPR webhooks (`customers/data_request`, `customers/redact`).
   - *Deliverable*: Scheduling service with retries and GDPR compliance.

8. **Integrate Notifications**
   - *Description*: Enable tier change notifications via Klaviyo.
   - *Tasks*:
     - Create endpoint: `POST /api/v1/notifications` with input validation.
