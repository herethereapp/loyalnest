To implement the RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) configuration feature for your Shopify loyalty app, targeting small and medium-sized merchants and leveraging your tech stack (NestJS with TypeScript, Vite + React, Rust with Shopify Functions, PostgreSQL, Redis), I'll provide a detailed task list based on the plan outlined earlier. This task list breaks down the implementation into actionable steps, covering backend, frontend, Shopify Functions, and testing, with considerations for usability, performance, and merchant needs. The tasks are prioritized to deliver a minimum viable feature quickly while allowing for iterative improvements.

Task List for Implementing RFM Configuration in Your Shopify Loyalty App

Phase 1: Planning and Setup

Goal: Establish the foundation for RFM configuration, ensuring alignment with merchant needs and tech stack.

Enhancements & Best Practices

Interview 2–3 merchants before finalizing requirements to ensure default thresholds and UI match real-world needs.

1. Define Feature Requirements

Description: Finalize the scope of RFM configuration, focusing on small and medium-sized merchants (100–10,000 customers, AOV $20–$200).

Tasks:

     - Document RFM threshold inputs (e.g., Recency: days, Frequency: orders, Monetary: spend).
     - Specify tier configuration (e.g., 2–5 tiers, name, RFM criteria, rewards).
     - Define adjustment frequency options (daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, event-based).
     - Include notification settings (e.g., Klaviyo integration, email templates).
     - Confirm analytics preview (e.g., segment size, repeat purchase rate).

Deliverable: Requirements document (e.g., in Notion or Google Docs).

2. Analyze Merchant Data Patterns

Description: Study typical purchase cycles and AOV for small/medium merchants to suggest default RFM thresholds.

Tasks:

     - Use Shopify Analytics or test store data to calculate median purchase interval and AOV.
     - Example: For AOV $50, suggest Monetary thresholds (5: $250+, 4: $100–$249, etc.).
     - Validate with 2–3 merchant personas (e.g., pet store, fashion boutique).

Deliverable: Default RFM thresholds and tier suggestions.

- Usability: Use Polaris for a familiar Shopify admin experience; include tooltips and examples.
- Scalability: Optimize for 100–10,000 customers, as medium-sized merchants may grow quickly.
- Support: Offer live chat or email support to guide setup, critical for small merchants.

Example Merchant Workflow

For a pet store (AOV $40, 1,000 customers):

- Configuration:
  - Recency: 5 = <30 days, 4 = 31–60 days, etc.
  - Frequency: 5 = 5+ orders, 4 = 3–4 orders.
  - Monetary: 5 = $200+, 4 = $100–$199.
  - Tiers: Gold (5-4-4), Silver (3-2-2), Bronze (1-1-1).
  - Frequency: Monthly, 30-day grace period.
- Outcome: 10% in Gold (100 customers), 25% increase in repeat purchases.

Next Steps

1. Start with Phase 1: Finalize requirements and analyze merchant data (5–6 days).
2. Prioritize Backend: Build Shopify API integration and RFM calculation first to validate data flow.
3. Test Early: Use a test store to simulate RFM configs before building the full UI.
4. Seek Feedback: Share the UI prototype with 1–2 friendly merchants for early input.
