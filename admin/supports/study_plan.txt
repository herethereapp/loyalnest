As a beginner with limited experience in Node.js, TypeScript, React, and Rust, this study plan is designed to help you master the tech stack (NestJS, Vite + React, Rust/Wasm, PostgreSQL, Redis, VPS/Docker) within the 6–8-month TVP timeline. It aligns with your Month 1 Sprint (schema, OAuth, /api/points) and leverages AI assistance (e.g., me, GitHub Copilot) to accelerate learning. The plan spans 8 weeks to cover Phase 1 (3–4 weeks) and prepare for Phase 2–3, focusing on practical, project-specific skills.

Week 1–2: TypeScript and NestJS Basics

	• Goal: Learn TypeScript and NestJS fundamentals to set up Shopify OAuth and /api/points in Month 1.
	• Resources: 
		○ TypeScript (2 hours): Watch “TypeScript Crash Course” by Traversy Media (YouTube, ~1 hour) or read TypeScript Handbook (basics: types, interfaces). Focus on interfaces (e.g., PointsDto) and type annotations.
		○ NestJS (4 hours): Watch “NestJS Crash Course” by freeCodeCamp (YouTube, ~2 hours) or read NestJS docs (Overview, Controllers, Modules). Understand @Controller, @Injectable, and modules.
		○ Shopify OAuth (2 hours): Read Shopify’s “Authenticate with OAuth” guide and @shopify/shopify-app-express docs.
	• Tasks: 
		○ Set up NestJS project (nest new LoyalNest) and install @shopify/shopify-app-express.
		○ Implement OAuth using my provided code (e.g., shopify.controller.ts from prior response).
		○ Ask me for explanations (e.g., “Explain NestJS decorators”) or code (e.g., “Write a NestJS API for points”).
		○ Practice: Create a simple NestJS API (e.g., /api/hello) with TypeScript interface.
	• AI Assistance: Request “Generate a NestJS controller for /api/points with TypeScript” or “Explain TypeScript interfaces for RFM data.”
	• Time: ~8 hours total (4 hours/week).

Week 3–4: PostgreSQL, Redis, and NestJS APIs

	• Goal: Set up PostgreSQL schema (loyalnest_full_schema.sql), integrate Redis, and build /api/referral and /api/analytics.
	• Resources: 
		○ PostgreSQL (3 hours): Watch “PostgreSQL Tutorial for Beginners” by Net Ninja (YouTube, ~1.5 hours). Focus on JSONB and indexes (e.g., customers.rfm_score).
		○ Redis (2 hours): Read Redis University’s “Introduction to Redis” (~1 hour) or watch “Redis Crash Course” by Traversy Media.
		○ NestJS APIs (3 hours): NestJS docs (Providers, Dependency Injection) and Twilio’s Node.js SDK guide for SMS.
	• Tasks: 
		○ Apply loyalnest_full_schema.sql to PostgreSQL (use Docker: docker run -d -p 5432:5432 postgres).
		○ Integrate TypeORM or Prisma with NestJS for PostgreSQL (e.g., save points to points_transactions).
		○ Set up Redis (e.g., docker run -d -p 6379:6379 redis) and cache points data.
		○ Build /api/referral with Twilio SDK in NestJS.
		○ Ask me for schema optimizations (e.g., “Suggest indexes for RFM queries”) or API code (e.g., “Write a NestJS API for Twilio SMS”).
	• AI Assistance: Request “Generate TypeORM setup for NestJS with PostgreSQL” or “Show Redis caching in NestJS.”
	• Time: ~8 hours total (4 hours/week).

Week 5–6: Vite + React and Polaris

	• Goal: Learn React and Vite to build WelcomePage.tsx and CustomerWidget.tsx for Month 3–4 sprint.
	• Resources: 
		○ React (3 hours): Watch “React Crash Course” by freeCodeCamp (YouTube, ~2 hours). Focus on hooks (useState, useEffect) and components.
		○ Vite (1 hour): Read Vite docs (Getting Started) or watch “Vite in 100 Seconds” by Fireship (YouTube).
		○ Polaris/App Bridge (2 hours): Read Shopify Polaris docs (Components) and App Bridge docs (React integration).
	• Tasks: 
		○ Set up Vite + React (npm create vite@latest --template react-ts).
		○ Install Polaris, Tailwind, and App Bridge (npm install @shopify/polaris @shopify/app-bridge-react tailwindcss).
		○ Build WelcomePage.tsx with Polaris Card and Text components.
		○ Ask me for components (e.g., “Write a Polaris-compliant React component for points”) or Vite setup (e.g., “Set up Vite with Polaris”).
	• AI Assistance: Request “Generate a React component for RFM chart with Chart.js” or “Explain React hooks for widget.”
	• Time: ~6 hours total (3 hours/week).

Week 7–8: Rust/Wasm and VPS Deployment

	• Goal: Learn Rust basics for Shopify Functions and set up VPS with Docker/Nginx for Month 5–8.
	• Resources: 
		○ Rust (3 hours): Read “Rust by Example” (Functions, Modules) or watch “Rust Crash Course” by Traversy Media (~1.5 hours).
		○ Shopify Functions (2 hours): Read Shopify’s “Functions API” docs and Shopify CLI guide.
		○ VPS/Docker (3 hours): Watch “Docker for Beginners” by TechWorld with Nana (YouTube, ~1.5 hours) and read Nginx docs (Reverse Proxy).
	• Tasks: 
		○ Install Rust (curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh).
		○ Create a sample Shopify Function with Rust (e.g., discount logic) using Shopify CLI.
		○ Set up VPS (e.g., Ubuntu 22.04): Install Docker (sudo apt install docker.io docker-compose), Nginx (sudo apt install nginx), and Git.
		○ Deploy NestJS and React with Docker Compose: 
yaml
CollapseWrap
Copy
version: '3'
services:
  backend:
    build: ./backend
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
  frontend:
    build: ./frontend
    ports:
      - "80:80"
  postgres:
    image: postgres:latest
    environment:
      POSTGRES_DB: LoyalNest
      POSTGRES_USER: user
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: password
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"
  redis:
    image: redis:latest
    ports:
      - "6379:6379"
		○ Configure Nginx as reverse proxy: 
nginx
CollapseWrap
Copy
server {
  listen 80;
  server_name yourdomain.com;
  location / {
    proxy_pass http://frontend:80;
  }
  location /api/ {
    proxy_pass http://backend:3000;
  }
}
		○ Ask me for Rust code (e.g., “Write a Rust Shopify Function for discounts”) or VPS setup (e.g., “Dockerize NestJS for VPS”).

	• Time: ~8 hours total (4 hours/week).

Ongoing (Month 3–8)

	• Testing: Learn Jest/Cypress in Month 3 (1 hour, Jest docs or Cypress “Getting Started”). Ask me for tests (e.g., “Write Jest tests for /api/points”).
	• Shopify Community: Join Shopify Reddit/Discord in Week 1 (1 hour) to recruit beta testers by Month 3.
	• AI-Driven Learning: Ask me for explanations (e.g., “What’s dependency injection in NestJS?”) or code reviews as you build APIs and components.
	• Practice: Build one feature at a time (e.g., /api/points in Week 3, WelcomePage.tsx in Week 5) to stay focused.

Tips to Avoid Failure

	• Incremental Learning: Spend 3–4 hours/week on tutorials, focusing on project-specific tasks (e.g., OAuth in Week 1).
	• AI Support: Use me to generate code, debug errors (e.g., “Fix this NestJS error”), or explain concepts (e.g., “What’s JSONB in PostgreSQL?”).
	• Git: Commit daily (e.g., git commit -m "Add OAuth API") to track progress and avoid loss.
	• Beta Testing: Share prototypes with 2–3 merchants by Month 3 to validate RFM usability, as per your plan.
	• Freelancer Coordination: Share Polaris mockups with your UI designer ($2,500) in Week 5 to guide React components.

Final Notes

	• Tech Stack: NestJS (TypeScript), Vite + React (TypeScript), Rust/Wasm, PostgreSQL (JSONB), Redis, and VPS (Docker/Nginx) form a robust stack for your TVP, supporting scalability and Shopify compliance.
	• Timeline: The 6–8-month TVP timeline accommodates NestJS’s learning curve, with VPS setup integrated into Month 5–8.
	• Study Plan: The 8-week plan covers critical skills (TypeScript, NestJS, React, Rust, VPS) for Month 1–4 sprints, with AI assistance to accelerate progress.
	• Next Steps: Start Week 1 by setting up NestJS and PostgreSQL, using my provided code. Join Shopify Reddit/Discord for community feedback. Ask me for specific code (e.g., “Write a NestJS API for RFM analytics”) or tutorials (e.g., “Explain Vite setup for React”) to stay on track.
