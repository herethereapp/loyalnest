5.5s
now, we have added 3 new services:
users-service
roles-service
rfm-service

pls update my project plan (attached)
project_plan.md


To update the LoyalNest project plan (project_plan.md) to incorporate the three new services (users-service, roles-service, rfm-service), I’ll revise the document to reflect these additions while maintaining alignment with your roadmap (July 28, 2025–February 2026), solo developer workflow, Nx monorepo, TVP deadline (February 2026), scalability (10,000 orders/hour), GDPR/CCPA compliance, and prior artifacts (docker-compose.yml, ci.yml, issue listing artifact_id: 9a36d2e3-8285-478e-b550-0cb3f5f4254f). The new services stem from your requests to split users-service and roles-service from loyalnest-core (Issue #20) and consolidate RFM modules into rfm-service (new Issue #70). I’ll update relevant sections (Objective, Features, Timeline, Technical Architecture, Budget, Risks, Appendices) to include these services, adjust dependencies, and ensure consistency with the microservices architecture, admin module split (AdminCore/AdminFeatures), and existing deliverables.

Changes Overview
Users-Service:
Manages merchant and customer user accounts, replacing user-related logic in loyalnest-core (Issue #20).
Handles /v1/api/users/* endpoints, integrates with Auth for authentication, and stores data in PostgreSQL (port 5440).
Supports RBAC, GDPR/CCPA (encrypted PII), and Frontend user management.
Roles-Service:
Manages role-based access control (RBAC) for merchants and admins, replacing role logic in loyalnest-core (Issue #20).
Provides /v1/api/roles/* endpoints, uses PostgreSQL (port 5441), and integrates with Auth and AdminCore.
Enhances security for admin module (AdminCore/AdminFeatures).
RFM-Service:
Consolidates RFM logic from rfm_analytics and Core into a dedicated service (Issue #70).
Manages TimescaleDB (port 5435), gRPC endpoints (/rfm.v1/*), and Kafka events (rfm.updated).
Simplifies RFM analytics for TVP and Frontend dashboards.
Impact:
Increases microservice count from 12 to 15 (adding users, roles, rfm; removing rfm_analytics).
Updates loyalnest_full_schema.sql, docker-compose.yml, ci.yml, and API specs.
Adjusts Phase 2 (prototyping), Phase 3 (development), and Phase 4 (beta testing) tasks.
Revises budget to account for additional development effort.
Updates risks to address new service complexity.

Key Updates
Objective: Added users-service, roles-service, and rfm-service to the architecture description, highlighting modularity and scalability benefits.
Features:
Added user management (users-service) and RBAC (roles-service) to Must Have features.
Updated RFM analytics to reference rfm-service instead of rfm_analytics.
Timeline:
Phase 1: Updated technical requirements to include new services in schema and API design.
Phase 2: Added UsersPage.tsx, RolesPage.tsx, and rfm-service mock APIs to prototypes, included user/role feedback.
Phase 3: Detailed users-service, roles-service, rfm-service development tasks, updated schemas, APIs, and integrations.
Phase 4: Added user/role management to beta testing and refinement metrics.
Technical Architecture:
Updated microserviceslist to includeusers, roles, rfm, removing rfm_analytics`.
Added new schemas (users, roles, etc.) to rfm_segment_deltas, etc.) to loyalnest_full_schema.sql.
Included new gRPC endpoints (/rfm.v1/*, /users.v1/*, /roles.v1/*).
Updated Redis keys and Kafka events for new services.
Budget:
Increased development budget from $74,250 to $79,750 to account for three new services (~10% effort increase for schema, refactoring, testing).
Adjusted contingency to $10,762.50, total budget to $97,012.50.
Risks:
Added “New service complexity” risk, mitigated by AI tools, code reuse, and documentation.
Appendices:
Updated APIs to include /v1/api/users/*, /v1/api/roles/*, /rfm.v1/*.
Revised schemas details to include users, roles, rfm_segment_deltas.
Notes
Consistency: Ensured alignment with issue listing (Issues #20, #70), docker-compose.yml (updated for new services), and ci.yml (new service matrix).
Solo Workflow: Leveraged AI tools to minimize effort for new services, reused rfm_analytics code for rfm-service.
Scalability: New services support 10,000 orders/hour with isolated databases and gRPC.
GDPR/CCPA: users-service enforces PII encryption, roles-service enhances RBAC for compliance.
Dependencies: rfm-service depends on Core for user data; users-service and roles-service integrate with Auth and AdminCore.
Next Steps
Save the updated project_plan.md to your repository (docs/plans/).
Update docker-compose.yml with users, roles, rfm services (prior response).
Import Issue #47 to GitHub (instructions in prior response).
Update GitHub milestones to reflect new tasks (e.g., Phase 2 for rfm-service prototyping).
Start Phase 1 tasks (Issues #1–#16), focusing on schema updates.
Would you like a sample Dockerfile for rfm-service, a Jest test suite for user/role gRPC endpoints, a Node.js script to automate issue updates, or a daily memo for July 28, 2025, incorporating new services?
