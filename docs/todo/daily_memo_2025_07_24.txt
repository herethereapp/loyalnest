Daily Memo — Microservices Health Check Setup
Date: 2025-07-24

Summary
Today, we completed a comprehensive health check integration across all your microservices in the LoyalNest project. This involved:

Creating standardized NestJS health.controller.ts and health.module.ts files for each microservice.

Leveraging shared health indicators (KafkaHealthIndicator, RedisHealthIndicator, PostgresHealthIndicator) from the common @loyalnest/health-check library.

Ensuring consistent checks for critical dependencies:

PostgreSQL — Database connectivity and query health

Redis Cluster — Cache and session store readiness

Kafka — Event broker availability for async messaging

Confirming modular, reusable code architecture to avoid duplication and enable easier maintenance.

Reviewing best practices for microservices resilience and monitoring.

Microservices Covered
admin_core-service

admin_features-service

api-gateway

auth-service

campaign-service

core-service

event_tracking-service

frontend

gamification-service

points-service

products-service

referrals-service

rfm_analytics-service

Next Steps
Integrate these health endpoints into your Kubernetes or Docker Compose probes for liveness/readiness.

Establish centralized monitoring dashboards (e.g., Prometheus + Grafana) using these health endpoints.

Automate alerting on any service dependency failures.

Continue enhancing resilience features like circuit breakers, retries, and fallback handlers.

Proceed with end-to-end testing to validate real-world failure scenarios and recovery.


Daily Memo: LoyalNest Shopify App - July 24, 2025
To: Solo DeveloperDate: July 24, 2025Subject: Daily Progress and Next Steps  
Overview
Today, significant progress was made on enhancing the system_architecture_and_specifications.txt document by integrating the API Gateway microservice and addressing key requirements for deployment (Helm/Kubernetes), observability (OpenTelemetry), Redis (expiry, clustering, RedisGuard), resilience (retries, fallbacks), testing (Pact contract testing), and rate limiting (global and per-merchant). These updates align with the TVP timeline for Phase 3 delivery by February 2026, ensuring scalability for 5,000+ merchants and compliance with Shopify and GDPR/CCPA standards.
Accomplishments

System Architecture Update: Revised system_architecture_and_specifications.txt to include the API Gateway microservice, detailing its role in routing, rate limiting, and observability with OpenTelemetry tracing integrated into Grafana.
Deployment Enhancements: Specified Helm/Kubernetes for staging/production with automated CI/CD via GitHub Actions, maintaining Docker Compose for local/test environments.
Observability: Added OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing across all microservices, enhancing end-to-end request visibility in Grafana.
Redis Optimization: Implemented cache expiry policies (e.g., 24h for points, 7d for referrals), enforced clustering, and added RedisGuard for data integrity and anti-corruption.
Resilience: Configured retries (3 attempts, 5s timeout) and AWS SES fallbacks for external API calls (Shopify, Klaviyo, Postscript, Square) to improve reliability.
Testing Strategy: Incorporated Pact contract testing for inter-service communication (e.g., API Gateway ↔ Core, Points), ensuring robust integration.
Rate Limiting: Defined global (10 req/s) and per-merchant (5 req/s) rate limits for referral and points endpoints, tracked via Redis.

Next Steps

Test Integration: Run npx nx test to validate updated microservices, focusing on Pact contract tests for API Gateway interactions with Core, Points, and Referrals services.
Commit Changes: Finalize and commit updates to system_architecture_and_specifications.txt using the provided Git commands:git add system_architecture_and_specifications.md
git commit -m "Update system architecture with Helm/K8s, OpenTelemetry, RedisGuard, retries, Pact testing, and rate limits"


Helm Chart Development: Begin drafting Helm charts for staging/production deployment, prioritizing Horizontal Pod Autoscaling for Plus merchants handling 10,000 orders/hour.
OpenTelemetry Validation: Set up a test environment to verify OpenTelemetry tracing spans for API Gateway, Shopify API calls, and gRPC/REST interactions, ensuring metrics appear in Grafana.
RedisGuard Implementation: Develop RedisGuard validation logic to enforce schema consistency for critical caches (e.g., points:customer:{id}, api_rate_limit:{merchant_id}).
Resilience Testing: Use Chaos Mesh to simulate Shopify and Klaviyo API failures, validating retry and fallback mechanisms.
Merchant Feedback: Share architecture updates with the “LoyalNest Collective” Slack community to gather early feedback on rate limiting and observability features.

Reminders

Timeline: Stay on track for Phase 3 deliverables by February 2026, prioritizing Must Have features like points, referrals, and RFM analytics.
Budget: Monitor resource usage within the $91,912.50 budget, leveraging AI tools (GitHub Copilot, Cursor) for efficiency.
Shopify Compliance: Ensure API Gateway rate limits align with Shopify’s 2 req/s (standard) and 40 req/s (Plus) restrictions.
Multilingual Support: Validate API Gateway’s OpenAPI/Swagger documentation for English, Spanish, French, and Arabic (RTL) compatibility.

Notes

Continue using dev.sh for local development to simulate rate limits and RFM scores, ensuring alignment with production behavior.
Schedule a review of k6 load test results tomorrow to confirm API responses remain <200ms under simulated Black Friday surges.
Consider early exploration of Shopify Flow templates (Phase 5) to align with API Gateway’s routing capabilities.

Keep up the momentum! Let me know if you need assistance with Helm charts, OpenTelemetry setup, or further refinements.
