Here's a Resilience Checklist tailored for your Shopify loyalty app with microservices, covering code, infra, observability, queues, cache, databases, deployments, and incident readiness.

‚úÖ Microservices Resilience Checklist
üß± SERVICE DESIGN

Core Principles

 Each service has clear boundaries and owns its own data.
 APIs are idempotent (safe for retries).
 Use timeouts on all outgoing HTTP/gRPC/Kafka calls (‚â§ 5s).
 Use bulkheads (separate workers/pools for async + user traffic).
 Gracefully degrade on failure (e.g. show cached data or fallback UI).

üß∞ CODE SAFEGUARDS
Retry + Timeout + Circuit Breaker
 Retry logic with exponential backoff and jitter (@nestjs/terminus, axios-retry, bullmq-retry).
 Circuit breaker per external dependency (e.g., Klaviyo, Shopify API).
 Fallback logic (e.g., use SES if Postscript fails).
Validation & Contracts
 DTOs with strict validation (e.g., class-validator, Zod).
 Versioned APIs (/v1/api/...).
 Consumer contracts tested (e.g., with Pact or schema validators).

üóÉÔ∏è DATA & CACHING
Database & Redis
 Database queries are parameterized, use connection pooling.
 Redis TTLs for all keys (config:{merchant_id}, jwt:{merchant_id}).
 Use Redis Cluster for scale-out, with fallback detection.
Eventual Consistency
 Use Kafka event versioning and idempotency keys.
 Store event delivery metadata to prevent re-processing.
 Implement compensating actions for partial failures (e.g., refund points).

üß© ASYNC JOBS
Queues & Streams
 Bull queues have:
 Retry strategy
 Dead letter queue (DLQ)
 Job expiration
 Redis Streams use max length + XREADGROUP with timeouts.
 Async imports/exports throttled by merchant plan.

üõ∞Ô∏è OBSERVABILITY
Logging, Metrics, Tracing
 Add x-request-id or trace_id to every request.
 Centralized structured logs (e.g., Loki, ELK).
 Prometheus metrics:
 Service uptime
 Queue length
 DB/Redis errors
 Kafka consumer lag
 Distributed tracing (OpenTelemetry):
 gRPC
 Kafka
 HTTP

üåê NETWORK & COMMUNICATION
 All internal services use gRPC or signed JWTs for secure auth.
 IP allowlisting + HMAC for sensitive endpoints.
 Use WebSocket fallback detection (reconnect logic, TTL).

üöÄ DEPLOYMENT & RUNTIME
CI/CD Resilience
 Health checks (e.g., /healthz, DB+Redis+Kafka).
 Rollbacks enabled (last 2 builds retained).
 Canary deployments supported.
 Feature flags for new functionality rollout.

Container & Infra
 Use Kubernetes readiness + liveness probes.
 Each service resource-limited (CPU/mem).
 Autoscaling policies defined per service.

üìõ INCIDENT READINESS
Incident Playbook
 Alerting setup (e.g., via Prometheus + Alertmanager or Grafana Cloud).
 Incident runbooks exist per service (see below template).
 Each critical event has:
 Monitoring
 Retry path
 Slack/Discord alert
 Dashboard visualization
On-Call Practices
 Team rotation with escalation rules.
 Clear SLO/SLA per service (e.g., points-service: 99.95%).

üì¶ EXTRAS
Disaster Recovery
 Redis persistence + backups enabled.
 Daily Postgres backup + WAL archiving.
 Kafka topic retention policy + offset monitoring.
Load & Chaos Testing
 Run stress tests with Locust/K6 against referral and points services.
 Use chaos scripts (kill pod, kill Redis node, drop Kafka consumer) regularly.

## 1. API Contract Alignment (REST/gRPC)
- [ ] Use OpenAPI spec (REST) or Protobuf (gRPC) with shared schema repository
- [ ] Validate incoming payloads using schema-based validation (e.g., Zod, Joi, class-validator)
- [ ] Standardize error response format across all services
- [ ] Enforce versioning (e.g., `/v1/...`) in all public endpoints
- [ ] Implement request/response timeout defaults (REST: e.g., 10s; gRPC: e.g., 5s)
- [ ] Retry logic for transient failures (client-side, e.g., Axios/gRPC clients)

---
## 2. Asynchronous Communication (BullMQ / RabbitMQ)
- [ ] Centralized job naming convention (e.g., `points.calculate`, `rfm.recalculate`)
- [ ] All jobs include correlation ID for traceability
- [ ] Dead-letter queues configured for failed jobs
- [ ] Retry with backoff on transient failures
- [ ] Queue consumers are idempotent and fault-tolerant
- [ ] Metrics emitted (e.g., job success/failure rates, queue length)

---
## 3. Docker & Orchestration
- [ ] Every service has its own `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.override.yml`
- [ ] Healthcheck defined in Docker for each service
- [ ] `.env.example` and `.env` used consistently
- [ ] Volumes are mounted for logs/data when needed
- [ ] Docker Compose or Helm charts define dependency order (e.g., DB before API)
- [ ] Services restart policy set to `on-failure` or `always`

---
## 4. Shared Auth/Session State
- [ ] Use a centralized auth service with token issuance (e.g., JWT, session cookie)
- [ ] All services validate tokens via shared secret or JWKS (for rotation)
- [ ] Session store (e.g., Redis) shared across services
- [ ] Include `x-user-id` or similar headers in internal calls for context
- [ ] Tokens include scopes/roles, validated at service layer

---
## 5. Distributed Tracing and Logging
- [ ] OpenTelemetry or equivalent tracer integrated in all services
- [ ] Use correlation ID (e.g., `X-Request-Id`) passed across all service calls
- [ ] Logs structured (JSON), and include:
  - service name
  - trace ID
  - timestamp
  - log level
- [ ] Logs forwarded to centralized system (e.g., ELK, Grafana Loki)
- [ ] Use alerting for key metrics: error rate, latency, queue delay

---
## 6. Environment and Configuration
- [ ] Each service has `.env.example` with:
  - `PORT`, `LOG_LEVEL`, `SERVICE_NAME`, etc.
- [ ] Configs are loaded using `@nestjs/config`, `dotenv`, or equivalent
- [ ] Use config validation on startup (e.g., using Zod or Joi)
- [ ] Secrets never hardcoded ‚Äî use `.env`, Vault, or secret manager

---
## 7. Test and Failover Preparedness
- [ ] Each service has e2e test service (e.g., `core-service-e2e`)
- [ ] Simulate downstream failure (e.g., via Chaos Mesh or mocks)
- [ ] Circuit breakers (e.g., `opossum`) on external or unstable calls
- [ ] Fallback logic where applicable
- [ ] Redundancy in Redis, PostgreSQL, RabbitMQ (clustering)

---
## 8. Observability and Ops
- [ ] Prometheus metrics exposed at `/metrics`
- [ ] Dashboards per service (Grafana / DataDog)
- [ ] Use status pages or synthetic checks for uptime
- [ ] Alert fatigue managed via thresholds and deduplication
- [ ] Document runbooks per service

---
## Appendix
- `shared/` folder includes types, constants, protobufs, API specs
- Consider using Nx generator or Plop templates to scaffold consistent services
- Set up CI to verify schema compatibility, openapi diff, lint, test
