Great! As a solo developer building a Shopify app with help from AI, your GitHub project management should be simple, automated, and focused on shipping fast, while keeping your code clean and deployable.

🔧 Recommended GitHub Setup for You
✅ 1. Repository Structure
Use a monorepo if you have both backend and frontend:

bash
复制
编辑
shopify-app/
├── backend/            # Axum, Node.js, or any backend
├── frontend/           # React + Vite + Tailwind + Polaris
├── prisma/             # DB schema (if using Prisma)
├── scripts/            # Utility scripts for deploy/dev
├── .github/
│   ├── workflows/      # GitHub Actions CI/CD
│   └── ISSUE_TEMPLATE/
├── README.md
├── .gitignore
└── package.json        # Or Cargo.toml if Rust
✅ 2. GitHub Issues = Task Tracker
Use Issues like a to-do list, with labels:

Label	Purpose
feature	New functionality (e.g., "Add referral logic")
bug	Fix something broken
enhancement	Improve existing behavior
question	AI prompts or research needed
backend	Related to backend APIs
frontend	UI or customer/admin features

You can also use milestones like:

v0.1 MVP

v1.0 Launch

✅ 3. Project Board (Kanban)
Use GitHub Projects (Beta) or basic Kanban:

To Do – tasks from issues

In Progress – what you're currently building

Blocked/AI Needed – waiting for design/help/decision

Done – completed features

You can link issues to the board cards directly.

✅ 4. Branching Strategy
Keep it light:

bash
复制
编辑
main       ← stable, deployable version
dev        ← working branch (optional)
feature/... ← new work
Examples:

bash
复制
编辑
feature/shopify-oauth
feature/loyalty-api
fix/auth-redirect
After completing work, create a pull request even for yourself (to track changes, or let AI tools comment later).

✅ 5. Automate with GitHub Actions
Example Workflows:
CI: Lint, test, typecheck on push

Deploy: Deploy to EC2 / Fly.io / Railway / Vercel

yaml
复制
编辑
# .github/workflows/dev.yml
name: Dev Build Check
on: [push]
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - run: npm install
    - run: npm run lint
    - run: npm run build
You can tailor this to run cargo check, cargo fmt, vite build, or shopify app dev depending on your stack.

✅ 6. Documentation
Keep everything in your repo:

README.md with:

What it does

How to run locally (npm run dev, cargo run, etc.)

How to deploy

docs/ folder (optional):

App architecture

Shopify API flow (OAuth, webhooks, etc.)

AI prompt logs or system design notes

✅ 7. Use PRs as Checkpoints
Even if you're solo:

Open PRs with a checklist

Document decisions

Let AI generate PR descriptions for you

This acts like a journal of what you’ve done, and helps future debugging.

✅ 8. Tag Releases
bash
复制
编辑
git tag v0.1.0
git push origin v0.1.0
Then create a GitHub Release with notes like:

"Added Shopify OAuth"

"Basic Points API"

"Initial Merchant UI"

💡 Bonus Tips
Use GitHub Copilot or ChatGPT to:

Generate issue templates

Auto-fill pull request bodies

Review code diffs

Use labels like ai-assist, needs-prompt, copilot-generated

Create reusable task templates:

markdown
复制
编辑
## Task
<brief desc>

## Subtasks
- [ ] Backend
- [ ] Frontend
- [ ] Test cases
- [ ] Deploy
✅ Example: Shopify App GitHub Workflow
Task	GitHub Feature Used
Plan features	Issues & Labels
Track progress	GitHub Project Kanban
Manage code	Branches + PRs
Automate testing/deploy	GitHub Actions
Release stable versions	Tags + Releases
Document design	README + /docs/
