Implementation Notes
Inter-Service Communication:
Synchronous (gRPC/REST): Used for real-time queries (e.g., /core.v1/GetCustomerRFM) with low latency. API Gateway routes all external requests and validates tokens via Auth.
Asynchronous (Kafka): Used for high-throughput, decoupled workflows (e.g., points.earned → RFM Analytics → Core). Expanded to Core, AdminCore, Event Tracking for GDPR/CCPA and task coordination.
Saga Patterns: Ensure eventual consistency (e.g., Points → RFM Analytics → Core; AdminCore → Core for GDPR).
Nx Monorepo:
Store plans in docs/plans/.
Use libs/kafka and libs/database for shared logic.
Testing:
Jest: Test inter-service calls (e.g., CoreService calling /auth.v1/ValidateMerchant).
Cypress: Validate gRPC/REST flows (e.g., Frontend → API Gateway → Points).
k6: Simulate 10,000 orders/hour for Points, Referrals, API Gateway.
Deployment:
Update docker-compose.yml with Kafka, Zookeeper, and all databases (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, TimescaleDB, Elasticsearch).
Example Kafka service:

GDPR/CCPA:
Core, AdminCore, AdminFeatures handle PII encryption (email, credentials).
Kafka events (gdpr_request.created, audit_log) ensure compliance logging.
Solo Developer:
Use AI tools (Grok, Copilot, Cursor) for 30–40% efficiency.
Prioritize Points, Referrals, RFM Analytics for TVP; defer Gamification, Products to Phase 6.
Would you like a consolidated docker-compose.yml for all services, a Jest test suite for inter-service communication (e.g., gRPC calls, Kafka events), or additional entity definitions (e.g., AuditLog.entity.ts)?
