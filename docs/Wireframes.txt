Creating wireframes for the Herethere Loyalty App is an excellent way to visualize the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) for both merchants and customers, complementing the user stories and flow diagram already discussed. Wireframes will help you, as a solo developer, plan the frontend (built with Vite + React and Shopify Polaris), ensure usability for your Shopify app’s points program, and demo the UI to beta merchants or Shopify App Store reviewers. Below, I’ll explain the purpose of wireframes, propose wireframes for key components (merchant dashboard and customer widget), and provide text-based descriptions (using ASCII or structured text) since I can’t generate graphical images directly. I’ll tailor this to your tech stack (NestJS, Vite + React, PostgreSQL, Redis, Twilio) and the points program logic (e.g., earning 1000 points for a $100 purchase, redeeming 200 points for a 10% discount).

Purpose of Wireframes
Wireframes are low-fidelity, simplified visual representations of the app’s UI, focusing on layout, navigation, and functionality without detailed styling. For the Herethere Loyalty App, wireframes serve to:
	• Define UI Layout: Plan the merchant dashboard (for configuring points and rewards) and customer widget (for viewing points and redeeming rewards).
	• Validate User Experience: Ensure merchants can easily set up the points program and customers can intuitively earn/redeem points.
	• Guide Development: Provide a blueprint for your React frontend, using Shopify Polaris for the dashboard and Tailwind CSS for the widget.
	• Demo to Stakeholders: Show beta merchants and Shopify reviewers how the app looks and feels, aligning with user stories (e.g., “As a merchant, I want to set points per dollar”).
	• Iterate Early: Catch usability issues before coding, saving time as a solo developer.

To create an ASCII wireframe for all pages of the Herethere Loyalty App based on the provided roadmap (from the document roadmap.txt), I’ll design wireframes for the Merchant Dashboard and Customer Widget pages as outlined in the roadmap, covering all specified features across Phases 1–3. The roadmap details the following pages for the Merchant Dashboard: Welcome Page, Points Program, Referrals Program, Customers, Analytics, Settings, On-Site Content, VIP Tiers, Activity Logs, and Bonus Campaigns. For the Customer Widget, it includes a single interface with points balance, redemption options, referral popup, RFM nudges, VIP tiers, gamification, and multilingual support. The Admin Module pages (Overview, Merchants, Admin Users, Logs, Plan Management, Integration Health, RFM Config Management, RFM Segment Export) will also be included.

Since ASCII wireframes are text-based and limited in expressiveness, I’ll use simple layouts with labeled sections to represent each page’s key components, ensuring all features from the roadmap are covered. Each wireframe will be clearly labeled with the page name and include placeholders for UI elements like buttons, lists, charts, and inputs, as described in the roadmap. The wireframes will be grouped under a single <xaiArtifact> tag with text/plain content type, as ASCII art is best represented as plain text. A new UUID will be used since this is a distinct artifact from previous flowcharts.

Wireframe Design Notes
Merchant Dashboard: Built with Vite + React, includes pages like WelcomePage.tsx, PointsPage.tsx, etc., with features like setup tasks, points configuration, RFM charts (Chart.js), and on-site content (e.g., loyalty page, popups).
Customer Widget: A React component displaying points balance, redemption options, referral popup, RFM nudges, VIP tiers, gamification (badges, leaderboards), and multilingual support.
Admin Module: Includes pages for merchant management, logs, and advanced configurations, accessible to admins.
Constraints: ASCII art will use simple characters (e.g., |, -, +, []) to represent layouts. Complex elements like charts will be indicated with placeholders (e.g., [Chart]).
Content: Each page will reflect features from Phases 1–3, with annotations for phase-specific additions (e.g., VIP Tiers in Phase 2, Bonus Campaigns in Phase 3).

Customers: Lists customers with name, email, points, RFM segments, and search (Phase 1).
Analytics: Shows metrics (members, points, ROI) and RFM charts, with advanced reports (Phase 2, 3).
Settings: Configures store details, billing, RFM thresholds (Phase 2), and developer toolkit (Phase 3).

RFM Config Management: Configures RFM thresholds with a preview (Phase 2).
RFM Segment Export: Exports segment data with charts (Phase 3).
Notes
ASCII Limitations: The wireframes use simple borders and labels to represent UI elements. Complex components like charts are marked as [Chart], and buttons/inputs are indicated with [Button: ...] or [Input: ...].
Completeness: All pages and features from the roadmap (Phases 1–3) are included, with phase-specific additions noted (e.g., (P2) for Phase 2 features).
Usage: Copy the ASCII text into a text editor or view it in a terminal for clarity. If you need a graphical wireframe (e.g., using a tool like Figma exported to ASCII), let me know.
Testing: If you’re using the Python GUI app (flowchart_gui_app_optimized.py), these wireframes complement the flowchart by showing UI layouts. You can paste the corrected Mermaid code (artifact ID: 5e11d3d7-6396-4f44-af72-9e5d934918fc) into the app to visualize the structure.
If you need adjustments (e.g., more detailed ASCII art, specific page focus, or integration with the Python GUI app), or if you want to test these wireframes in a different format, please let me know! Also, confirm if the Python GUI app is now working after resolving the Graphviz issue, and share any flowchart_app.log contents if issues persist.

How to Use Wireframes
	• Development: 
		○ Use these wireframes to guide your React frontend implementation, ensuring the merchant dashboard uses Polaris components and the customer widget is lightweight for storefront integration.
		○ Store wireframes in docs/wireframes/ as text files or export PNGs from Figma if you create them there.
	• Demo: 
		○ Share with beta merchants to validate usability (e.g., “Is the rewards table intuitive?”).
		○ Include in Shopify App Store submission to show UI compliance with Shopify’s design standards.
	• Iteration: 
		○ Test with 1–2 beta merchants and adjust based on feedback (e.g., add a “Preview” button for rewards).
Tools to Create Wireframes
Since you’re a solo developer, use these free/low-cost tools to refine these wireframes:
	• Figma (Free Tier): Create interactive mockups with Polaris components (Shopify provides a Polaris Figma kit).
	• Balsamiq: Quick low-fidelity wireframes (free trial available).
	• Draw.io: Integrate with VS Code or GitHub for simple layouts.
	• Mermaid: Extend the flow diagram approach to UI layouts (less common but possible).
If you want to create these yourself, copy the ASCII layouts above into a Figma frame or Balsamiq project and add Polaris/Tailwind styling placeholders.
Additional Notes
	• Polaris Compliance: Ensure the merchant dashboard uses Polaris components (Tabs, FormLayout, Button) to align with Shopify’s UX standards.
	• Responsive Design: The customer widget should be mobile-friendly (use Tailwind’s sm:, md: classes).
	• Accessibility: Add ARIA labels (e.g., aria-label="Redeem 200 points for 10% discount") for screen readers.
	• Analytics: Track widget interactions with PostHog (e.g., posthog.capture('redeem_clicked')).
If You Want More
If you need additional wireframes or modifications, please specify:
	• Other Screens: E.g., referral UI, POS integration, or analytics dashboard.
	• Fidelity: Medium-fidelity with Polaris/Tailwind styles or interactive prototypes.
	• Format: More detailed ASCII, Markdown tables, or guidance for Figma setup.
	• Specific Features: E.g., focus on SMS referral flow or analytics charts.
Alternatively, I can generate a sequence diagram to complement the flow diagram and wireframes, or refine the user stories to align with these UIs. Let me know your priority!
